    # Introduction
  The AMIS−30623 is a single−chip micro−stepping motordriver with
  position controller and control/diagnostic interface. It is ready to build
  dedicated mechatronics solutions connected remotely with a LIN master.
  The chip receives positioning instructions through the bus and
  subsequently drives the motor coils to the desired position. The
  on−chip position controller is configurable (OTP or RAM) for
  different motor types, positioning ranges and parameters for speed,
  acceleration and deceleration. The AMIS−30623 acts as a slave on the
  LIN bus and the master can fetch specific status information like
  actual position, error flags, etc. from each individual slave node.
  An integrated sensor−less step−loss detection prevents the
  positioner from loosing steps and stops the motor when running into
  stall. This enables silent, yet accurate position calibrations during a
  referencing run and allows semi−closed loop operation when
  approaching the mechanical end−stops.
  The chip is implemented in I2T100 technology, enabling both high
  voltage analog circuitry and digital functionality on the same chip.
  The AMIS−30623 is fully compatible with the automotive voltage
  requirements
